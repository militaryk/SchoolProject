# Acids and Bases

A base is a substance with a ph level higher than 7, and an Acid is a substance with a ph lower than 7



##### What is the relationship between Alkalis and Bases
**Bases** are substances that react with **acids** and neutralise them. They often come as metal oxides, metal hydroxides, metal carbonates. Nearly all types of **bases** are insoluble. Insoluble means they do not dissolve in water. If a **base** dissolves in water, we call it **alkali**
