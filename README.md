# *Acids and Bases*

A **Base** is a substance with a ph level higher than 7, and an **Acid** is a substance with a ph level lower than 7


### What is the relationship between Alkalis and Bases
**Bases** are substances that react with **acids** and neutralise them. They often come as metal oxides, metal hydroxides, metal carbonates. Nearly all types of **bases** are insoluble. Insoluble means they do not dissolve in water. If a **base** dissolves in water, we call it **alkali**

### Universal Indicator Vrs Litmus Paper
#### Universal Indicator
Universal indicator is a combination of multiple different indicators. Unlike litmus, universal indicator has the ability to show us almost exactly how acidic or alkaline a solution is. This is measured using the pH scale. The pH scale goes from ph 0 to pH 14. Universal indicator changes to a different color when exposed to a solution, it would go red for strong acids to dark purple for strong bases. In the middle is green for Neutral pH 7
